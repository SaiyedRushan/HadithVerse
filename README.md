# HadithVerse
This project was created with React, Typescript, Algolia, Vite, Tailwind, and Shadcn UI.
It's a search application that searches through over 17,000 hadiths and the entire Quran. 
The search results are returned extremely quickly.
Algolia supports fuzzy and semantic search, which helps you research a topic or find a hadith even if you don't remember it exactly.
